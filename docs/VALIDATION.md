# Validation / Validación — 2026-10-26

Windows, Node v24.11.1, npm 11.6.2. Base commit 290e50c9007c381cca0c3c28be57239b4afa5de9.

- Baseline: npm test: 6 passed, 0 failed.
- npm ci: successful, four installed packages.
- Final npm test: 27 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; 11.17 seconds. Includes one parent test and eight browser/CLI subtests.
- npm audit --json: zero known vulnerabilities (five dependency metadata entries including root).
- git diff --check: passed.
- Real Chromium + axe found image-alt and button-name on a loopback fixture.
- Child CLI processes verified text, JSON, HTML file creation, exits 0/1/2, HTTP 404, missing output directory and Windows paths containing spaces, percent and hash.
- Six unit cases inject failures during context/page creation, navigation, analysis and both cleanup operations.

First browser run: 15 passed and 6 failed (parent included) because the execution sandbox changed the default browser cache path between commands. Installed Chromium into a persistent workspace path and reran successfully. The output-write test was strengthened to require ENOENT so a missing browser cannot falsely pass that assertion.

Reproduction in this workspace / Reproducción:
```powershell
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH = Join-Path (Get-Location) '..\browsers'
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npm test
npm audit --json
```
Normal installations can omit PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH. No browser download or node_modules are committed.

Pending / Pendiente: remote Actions Windows/Linux Node 22/24; clean Windows user installation and npm link; manual screen reader/keyboard review; authenticated sites; performance and adversarial network fixtures. No claim that these passed. No release, deployment or remote branch publication performed.

La fase 1 conserva la CLI y sus informes; multipágina, CSV, traducciones de recomendaciones, historial y UI pertenecen a las fases siguientes. El servicio actual ejecuta páginas con acceso a la red local: no usarlo como servicio expuesto ni afirmar protección SSRF.
